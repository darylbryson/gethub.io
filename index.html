          <h4>Father</h4>
          <p>I have been a father for sixteen years as of March 7th, 2019. My son, Oden, is an extremely intelligent young man that I am very pround to call my son.</p>
        </div>

          <h4>Son</h4>
          <p>My life began on August 28th, 1982. I am a loving son who cherishes his mother. I never had the opportunity to meet my father, much to my regret.</p>

          <h4>Musician</h4>
          <p>For more than 20 years I have been a musician. I started out on guitar and throughout the years I have taught myself how to sing and play paino. I primarily play Alternative/Rock.

        <h2>Current thoughts...</h2>
        <p>College has been quite the adventure. I have been enrolled for a little over one year and am about nine units away from sophmore status. Thus far, my coding class at Fresno City Online has been the most fun. Making this page has been the penacle of my experience. I never thought I would be writing code and making a web page! I can already make good use of the very little I have learned so far. A very gracious and humble "Thank You" to my computer information technology professor, Prof. Rio Waller.</p>
